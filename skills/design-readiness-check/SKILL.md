name: design-readiness-check
description: Check whether a design is complete enough to move into implementation planning. Use when a design appears mostly done and needs a final readiness review for missing branches, weak assumptions, unresolved risks, failure handling, validation gaps, or non-functional omissions. Trigger before invoking writing-plans or when the user asks whether the current design is ready to implement. Do not use as a general design-document audit for external docs or as a replacement for initial design work.

# Design Readiness Check

## Overview

This skill is the quality gate between design work and implementation planning.

Its job is to answer one question clearly: is the current design complete enough to move into `writing-plans`?

It is not a replacement for `design-decision-audit`. That skill audits standalone design or plan documents. This skill checks the readiness of an in-progress design workflow before planning.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- the design looks mostly complete
- the next possible step is `writing-plans`
- the user asks whether the design is ready to implement
- the remaining concern is completeness, not discovery

Do not use this skill when:

- the design tree is still missing
- major branches remain vague
- core decisions are still unresolved
- the user is asking for a general audit of an external design document

## Workflow

### Phase A: Context Preparation

Goal: Load design state and assemble context for parallel checks.

1. Load the current `design_state` from the conversation context.
2. Read the design tree content and all related context (open branches, decision nodes, risks, validation state).
3. If `design_state` does not exist or the design tree is empty, return NOT READY immediately with a handoff to `design-structure`.
4. Assemble a context package containing: design tree text, open branches, decision nodes, existing risks, validation entries.
5. Perform a lightweight structural integrity check using the shared rules in `design-tree-core/REFERENCE.md`:
   - mixed responsibilities inside one tree
   - parent/child ownership confusion
   - duplicated parent/child logic on the same branch
   - branches that likely should have been derived but were kept inline

### Phase B: Parallel Readiness Checks

Goal: Run four independent checks in parallel using specialized subagents.

6. Launch four parallel Sonnet subagents, each using one of the checker agent templates:
   - **branch-checker**: reads `skills/design-readiness-check/agents/branch-checker.md`. Fill `{{DESIGN_TREE}}` and `{{CONTEXT}}`.
   - **assumption-checker**: reads `skills/design-readiness-check/agents/assumption-checker.md`. Fill `{{DESIGN_TREE}}` and `{{CONTEXT}}`.
   - **failure-checker**: reads `skills/design-readiness-check/agents/failure-checker.md`. Fill `{{DESIGN_TREE}}` and `{{CONTEXT}}`.
   - **risk-checker**: reads `skills/design-readiness-check/agents/risk-checker.md`. Fill `{{DESIGN_TREE}}` and `{{CONTEXT}}`.

7. Collect results from all four subagents.

**Fallback**: If any subagent fails or times out, the main agent performs that check inline using the same rubric from the agent template.

### Phase C: Verdict Synthesis

Goal: Combine check results into a clear readiness judgment.

8. Map each subagent's `status` to a pass/fail entry in the readiness checklist:
   - branch-checker → "Design tree present" and "Key branches refined"
   - assumption-checker → "Decisions resolved" (if assumptions are unresolved)
   - failure-checker → "Failure paths documented" and "Validation strategy defined"
   - risk-checker → "Blocking risks mitigated"

9. Build the ✓/✗ checklist diagram following Diagram Conventions.

10. Determine verdict:
   - **READY**: all four checks return `pass` and no structural integrity issue is blocking
   - **NOT READY**: any check returns `fail` or structural integrity issues are blocking

11. If NOT READY, determine the handoff target based on which check failed:
    - branch-checker fails → hand off to `design-structure` (branches missing) or `design-refinement` (branches weak)
    - assumption-checker fails → hand off to `design-refinement` (assumptions need expansion)
    - failure-checker fails → hand off to `design-refinement` (failure paths need adding)
    - risk-checker fails → hand off to `decision-evaluation` (unresolved risk decision) or `design-refinement` (risk documentation weak)
    - structural integrity fails → hand off to `design-orchestrator` (re-route ownership), `design-structure` (derive a child tree), or `design-refinement` (shrink duplicated inline logic)

12. Update `design_state` with:
    - `status.ready_for_planning`: true or false
    - `status.blocking_issues`: list from failed checks
    - Updated `open_branches`, `risks`, `validation` if new information emerged

13. Return the explicit verdict with checklist diagram. Never give a "probably ready" answer.

## Readiness Standard

A design is ready for planning only when:

- the main design tree is present
- key branches are refined enough to guide implementation
- major decision nodes are resolved or explicitly deferred with acceptable rationale
- failure paths and validation strategy are not missing
- blocking risks are either mitigated or clearly acknowledged
- tree responsibilities are not mixed in a way that breaks routing clarity

## Expected Outputs

Produce or update a `design_state` that includes:

- `open_branches`
- `risks`
- `validation`
- `status.ready_for_planning`
- `status.blocking_issues`

Always return an explicit result:

- ready for planning
- not ready for planning

## Diagram Conventions

Present the readiness verdict as a status checklist inside a code block (no language tag):

```
Readiness Check
├── Design tree present          ✓
├── Key branches refined         ✓
├── Decisions resolved           ✗ (storage choice pending)
├── Failure paths documented     ✓
├── Validation strategy defined  ✓
└── Blocking risks mitigated     ✗ (migration cutover risk)

Verdict: NOT READY — 2 blocking issues
```

**Rules:**

- Use `✓` (pass) and `✗` (fail) markers with inline reason for failures
- Max width: 78 characters
- Always include this checklist in the readiness verdict

## Entry and Exit Criteria

Enter when:

- the design is near completion
- the next meaningful step may be implementation planning

Exit when:

- you have issued a clear readiness decision
- you have identified the next route if the design is not ready

## Handoff Rules

- Hand off to `writing-plans` only when the design is clearly ready.
- Hand off to `design-structure` when foundational branches are still missing.
- Hand off to `design-refinement` when important branches exist but are still weak.
- Hand off to `decision-evaluation` when the real blocker is an unresolved decision node.
- Hand off to `design-orchestrator` when the real blocker is tree ownership or routing drift rather than branch weakness.
- Never give a "probably ready" answer. The result must be explicit.
