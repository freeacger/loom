name: design-refinement
description: Refine an existing design tree until key branches become implementation-ready. Use when the high-level structure already exists but important branches remain vague, shallow, or unresolved. Trigger when the user needs deeper decomposition, edge-case coverage, failure-path clarification, interface detail, or validation criteria for a partially designed system. Do not use to create the initial design skeleton from scratch or to compare options for a single explicit decision node.

# Design Refinement

## Overview

This skill deepens an existing design tree.

Its job is to take major branches that are still vague and push them toward implementable leaf nodes. It should make the design more specific, more bounded, and harder to misread during implementation.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- the design tree already exists
- the design is still too high-level to guide implementation planning
- important branches lack interfaces, boundaries, failure behavior, or validation detail
- the user asks to make the design more concrete, more detailed, or more complete

Do not use this skill when:

- there is no design tree yet
- the main problem is a single bounded decision with multiple options
- the main question is whether the current design is ready for planning

## Leaf Node Standard

Treat a branch as implementation-ready only when its leaf nodes can answer:

1. What it is responsible for
2. What it is not responsible for
3. How it interacts with adjacent parts of the system
4. What failure looks like
5. How it will be validated

If those answers are still missing, the branch is not done.

## Core Responsibilities

Your responsibilities are:

1. Walk unresolved design branches one at a time.
2. Prioritize high-risk, high-dependency, or high-ambiguity branches first.
3. Expand branches into concrete sub-branches and leaf nodes.
4. Surface hidden assumptions and edge cases.
5. Add failure-path and validation detail where missing.
6. Explicitly mark newly discovered decision nodes instead of pretending they are settled.

## Expected Outputs

Produce or update a `design_state` that includes:

- refined `design_tree` branches
- updated `open_branches`
- `confirmed_assumptions`
- `risks`
- `validation`
- new `decision_nodes` if discovered

## Entry and Exit Criteria

Enter when:

- a design tree already exists
- important branches remain vague or incomplete

Exit when:

- key branches have been refined to implementation-ready leaves
- the remaining work is mainly decision evaluation or readiness checking

## Handoff Rules

- Hand off to `decision-evaluation` when you surface a clear decision node with multiple real options.
- Hand off to `design-readiness-check` when key branches are closed and the main question becomes readiness.
- Hand back to `design-structure` if the design tree itself is missing a foundational branch.
- Do not invent fake option comparisons just to make progress.
